# IIR_Melody_Generator
This project implements a digital signal processing (DSP) signal generator with an Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter for melody processing. It was designed to process melodies efficiently with optimized memory usage and speed. The system was tested with the classic song Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, achieving a 0.0356-second processing time.
